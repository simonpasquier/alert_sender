# Plan for testing that notifications honor send_resolved properly.

# With send_resolved: true
#
#  11:45 -> Received notification of service 1 and 3 down
#  12:00 -> Restored service 3
#  ~12:02 -> Received notification of service 1 down, service 3 solved
#  ~18:02 -> Received notification of service 1 down
#
# With send_resolved: false
#
#  11:45 -> Received notification of service 1 and 3 down
#  12:00 -> Restored service 3
#  ~17:45 -> Received notification of service 1 down
